    Hello! My name is Tanish Khot and I built this AI application to help detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images.

         This can be used by doctors to assist in their diagnosis, but it is not a replacement for human expertise.
         \n For the engineers: this model is trained on the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) from Kaggle.
         \bIt uses EfficientNetB0 architecture, which is known for its efficiency and accuracy in image classification tasks.
         The model has been trained to distinguish between normal and pneumonia-affected chest X-rays.
         The Grad-CAM technique is used to provide visual explanations of the model's predictions, highlighting
         the areas of the X-ray that contributed most to the decision.
